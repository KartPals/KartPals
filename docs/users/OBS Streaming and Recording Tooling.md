**How to run**

- First, you will need to open OBS Studio, click on the "Tools" Menu, and click
  on "WebSocket Server Settings" to enable merely complete control over OBS via
  data messaging from modern web apps.

- We recommend the port be 4455, so we don't have to add any logic (DO NOT
  complain about it saying the wrong port if your port isn't 4455)
